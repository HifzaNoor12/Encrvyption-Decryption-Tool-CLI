# Python_Encryption-decryption_tool
This is a python program to create an encryption and decryption Tool using all the traditional ciphers
# OVERVIEW OF TOOL:
This encryption/decryption tool is a user-friendly Python-based tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using classical ciphers. The tool incorporates a wide range of encryption algorithms. This tool will be accessible through both a command-line interface (CLI) as well as a graphical user interface (GUI), ensuring flexibility and ease of use.
# INSTRUCTIONS:
•	Select the cipher from the list of ciphers.
•	Enter the plaintext to be encrypted or decrypted.
•	Select the mode either you want to encrypt ('E') or decrypt ('D').
•	Provide the required key(s) for the chosen cipher.
•	Ensure keys meet specific requirements (e.g., coprime with 26).
•	Use integer keys for additive and multiplicative ciphers.
•	Enter two integer keys for affine ciphers.
•	Provide a key mapping for monoalphabetic substitution.
•	Enter a keyword for autokey, Playfair, and Vigenère ciphers.
•	Format plaintext and create a 5x5 matrix for the Playfair cipher.
•	For transposition ciphers, provide necessary keys and handle the text accordingly.
